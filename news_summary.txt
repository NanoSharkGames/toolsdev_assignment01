Animal Crossing: New Horizons review - a magical vivarium, and one of Nintendo's best games yet-
Animal Crossing: New Horizons has become a part of my life.
I don't know for sure, but such is the strange spell Animal Crossing casts, offering up a fantastical vivarium patrolled by anthropomorphic creatures that soon feels utterly, utterly real.
Progress in New Horizons is slow, as it always has been in Animal Crossing, but here it's got real purpose.
And it's how, even some 90 hours in, Animal Crossing: New Horizons maintains its ability to surprise.
He's a keeper, and so too is Animal Crossing: New Horizons, probably the best this series has ever had to offer and therefore one of Nintendo's very best games to date.

The Double-A Team: Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars does real justice to the series-
I suspect everyone has a game like Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars.
As it happens, my own personal Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars is Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars.
I'm not afraid to say it: I love Shadow Wars.
Ghost Recon was an intriguing series that has steadily been consumed by the Ubisoft machine.
Well Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars is a very good American Football game, if that makes sense.
